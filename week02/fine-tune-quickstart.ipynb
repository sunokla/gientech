The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

There were some delicious grilled onions on the burgers, too.  It was a huge meal, despite being an appetizer special.\\n\\nI got taco basket.  Three ground beef tacos.  There was a bit of lettuce, a bit of tomato and a pound of cheese.  I was in heaven with the cheese.  I dumped the lettuce, tomatoes and ate them with the cheese.  There was a small container of salsa, but it really had no flavor.  The tacos were actually smaller than I had expected, but they were tasty and not greasy.  \\n\\nThe food was much better than I had anticipated.  It was reasonably priced, too.\\n\\nOur server was obviously tired.  We went in during the early afternoon, after the lunch rush, on a Saturday.  I think the poor thing was just beat.

We almost left because no one came to take our order for several minutes.  \\n\\nI would give this place 3 stars for the food, but the darkness, the smoke and the slower service brings it down to a 2.

I've got good and bad to say.  \\n\\nThe GOOD - the guys were good performers with great bodies.  They took great care in paying attention to all areas of the audience and getting the crowd riled up. The environment was very intimate (read small -- 30 - 50 people tops).  If you are celebrating a bachelorette party or birthday, you'll easily get the guest of honor on stage (there were at least 6 ladies brought on stage throughout the performance -- and only about 30 in the audience!).  And domestic beer was VERY cheap ($1.50 for Bud products).\\n\\nThe BAD - the room is very small and has a very temporary feel to it.   The stage was actually some platform risers.  When the guys jumped, we felt it.  The catwalk area (which wasn't really used as a catwalk) was covered in velcroed, catering-style drapes.  I felt that the next night, the entire room could have been turned over for a banquet....because it literally was a banquet room.  The size of the room could be a good thing if you have the right crowd, but a less enthusiastic crowd would have resulted in a miserable, awkward feel.  Luckily -- our crowd was pretty good -- and with the cheap beers, all potential awkwardness was washed away soon into the show.\\n\\nAt some moments, the show was like a strip club (guys came into the audience and solicited dollar bills) and other times, it was more of a male review with dancing and a bit of acting.  I don't think I'd recommend this for random entertainment -- but it would be worthwhile for a bachelorette or birthday party.  Just be sure to have a few (strong) cocktails beforehand to prevent any awkward moments!</td>\n",

I love all the fresh red and yellow rose bouquets that they had at each table, very classy. I also had a decent view of the fountains, though my party was sitting about 4 tables back from the window. I liked the circus theme, it was done very creatively. The ambience is nice, but the food taste wise fell short especially for the price. The raspberry fizz martini was delicious though!\\n\\nI decided to try the chefs tasting menu (cost $88). I chose the caprese salad, duck ravioli, scallops, lamb and I picked the strawberry tart for dessert.\\n\\nThe food arrived within good time, though I thought it took the server a little too long to greet us and take our order at the beginning. \\n\\nThe caprese salad was just ok. It is served with a special kind of very smal leaf basil. There was only a little sprig of it, so there was essentially no basil flavor. Duck ravioli was nice, I liked the mushrooms it was paired with.\\n\\nOnly one scallop is served with the tasting menu but it is a large one. The presentation was very nice on this. I thought the scallop was cooked very well, and was one of my favorite dishes here, though I have had scallops at other places I liked better. \\n\\nI didn't really care much for the lamb (you pay an extra $9 for this). It is heavily encrusted in herbs, but surprisingly it didn't taste the strongly of herbs. The meat seemed fairly chewy, I had a hard time cutting it with my knife, and I had ordered it medium rare and it was really red. \\n\\nThe strawberry tart was ok. the arrangement of the strawberries on top of the tart was pretty. The filling was a mix of strawberries and something else? It was very mushy and didn't have much flavor. The was also a mini strawberry smoothie served along side. There were some pop rocks in it, so that was an interesting surprise. The strawberry sauce in the smoothie was a bit intense, tasted like fake strawberry syrup, it was too sweet. I think a smoothie made with real strawberries would have been better.</td>\n",
